Facebook Final Project for CPSC330

Things we absolutely need:
- New users can register to create new accounts, providing an email address and a password with which they can log in.
- Profile page with: at least least their name, birthdate, gender, current "status," and hobbies. All these fields are editable.
- Can request to be friends: Being someone's friend means (1) you will show up in the "Friends list" on their profile page and vice versa, and (2) you will be allowed to post on their Wall, and vice versa.
- Each user has a wall on their profile page (not the news feed)
- Persistent memory storage
